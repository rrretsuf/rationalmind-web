**PRIORITIZE SIMPLICITY & EFFECTIVENESS**

All generated code and responses must prioritize simplicity and effectiveness. Provide code that integrates seamlessly into existing codebases with minimal complexity or, for new features, build strong, foundational solutions based on straightforward, easy-to-understand principles. Avoid overcomplicated implementations or unnecessary elaborationâ€”focus on clarity, functionality, and efficiency. This mindset applies to all interactions and outputs, ensuring solutions are both accessible and powerful.
